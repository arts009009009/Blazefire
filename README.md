# Blazefire Framework 🔥

Blazefire is a chaos‑driven web framework with custom runtime, overlay branding, and compiler hooks.  
It’s inspired by modern meta‑frameworks like Next.js, but built with its own identity and features.

## Acknowledgements
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — for pioneering the meta‑framework model and inspiring routing + SSR concepts.
- Frostfast Compiler — powering Blazefire’s runtime speed.
- Community devs who shaped the ecosystem we build on.

## Features

- Cyberpunk/OLED dark theme
- Neon glow effects
- Flame logo with gradient
- Error overlay with custom branding
- DevTools indicator
- Frostfast compiler (SWC + Turbopack)

## Installation

Install straight from GitHub — the package is not published to npm.

```bash
npm install github:arts009009009/Blazefire
# or
yarn add github:arts009009009/Blazefire
```

That is all for npm and yarn. Your `next.config.*` is copied to
`Blazefire Backup/` and its export is wrapped with `blazefire()` — and
activation writes this into your `package.json`:

```json
"postinstall": "blazefire init || echo blazefire skipped"
```

A project's own scripts are never blocked, so once that line is committed
**every** package manager self-activates on install, including the two
below. Commit it alongside the config.

### pnpm

pnpm installs fine, but skips a *dependency's* build scripts by default, so
the very first install activates nothing. Bootstrap it once:

```bash
pnpm exec blazefire init      # or: pnpm approve-builds, then pnpm install
```

After that the hook takes over and no allowlist is needed. Worth knowing:
an `onlyBuiltDependencies` entry for a git dependency embeds the full commit
SHA, so it quietly stops matching on your next commit — the hook doesn't.

### bun

Same one-time bootstrap — bun blocks untrusted postinstalls:

```bash
bunx blazefire init
```

or allow the package outright in your `package.json`:

```json
"trustedDependencies": ["blazefire"]
```

### Monorepos and workspaces

Installing at the repository root is fine even when the root has no Next.js
config. The installer then looks inside the workspaces you have *declared* —
`package.json#workspaces` (npm, yarn, pnpm) or the `packages:` list in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` — and activates the one that actually holds a
`next.config.*`:

```text
elite-shop/              blazefire installed here
├── package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml    packages: ["frontend"]
└── frontend/             the app
    ├── next.config.ts      wrapped + copied to frontend/Blazefire Backup/
    └── package.json        receives the self-activation hook
```

The backup and the hook both land beside the app rather than at the root, and
`npx blazefire restore` reaches them from either place. Only declared
workspaces are searched — nothing is found by scanning directories — so the
outcome is deterministic.

### Not supported: Deno

Deno's installer only resolves npm-registry and JSR specifiers, so it drops
`github:` (and `git+https`) dependencies without an error. Use npm, yarn or
pnpm to install, then run `npx blazefire init`.

### Fallback (any manager, incl. `--ignore-scripts`)

```bash
npx blazefire init      # activate
npx blazefire restore   # put the original config back AND remove the hook
```

`init` never exits non-zero when it is running as your `postinstall` — a
deleted `next.config.*` must not be able to brick your install — but it still
exits 1 when you invoke it yourself and finds nothing to do.

Set `BLAZEFIRE_SKIP_AUTO=1` to opt out of auto-activation entirely: no hook
is written, and an existing hook honours the flag too.

## Usage

```jsx
import { BlazefireLogo, BlazefireErrorOverlay } from 'blazefire';
import { insertBlazefireStyles } from 'blazefire/styles';
import { createCompiler } from 'blazefire/compiler';

// Insert styles
insertBlazefireStyles();

// Create compiler instance
const compiler = createCompiler();

// Use components
function App() {
  return (
    <BlazefireErrorOverlay
      errorType="Runtime Error"
      errorMessage="Something went wrong"
      onClose={() => {}}
    />
  );
}
```

## Compiler

The Frostfast compiler provides:

- SWC-based transformations
- Turbopack bundling
- TypeScript/JSX support
- Hot module replacement

```js
import { createCompiler, FROSTFAST_VERSION } from 'blazefire/compiler';

const compiler = createCompiler({
  // Custom options
});

console.log(`Frostfast v${FROSTFAST_VERSION}`);
```

## Components

- `BlazefireLogo` - Flame logo with neon glow
- `BlazefireErrorHeader` - Error overlay header
- `BlazefireErrorOverlay` - Full error overlay
- `BlazefireDevToolsIndicator` - Floating dev tools button

## Styles

Import the CSS files for the full cyberpunk theme:

```css
@import 'blazefire/assets/blazefire-dark-theme.css';
@import 'blazefire/assets/blazefire-global.css';
```
